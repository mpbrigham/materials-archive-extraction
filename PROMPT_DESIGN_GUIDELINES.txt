PROMPT DESIGN GUIDELINES
=========================

“Form is emptiness. Emptiness is form.”

These guidelines focus on structure, content, and logic — the WHAT and WHY of each prompt.

1. PURPOSE FIRST
- Define the intent in 1–2 sentences before writing the prompt.
- Ensure that every section supports this purpose.
- Use explicit phrases like:
  - "Your task is to..."
  - "Return a JSON object conforming to the following schema..."

2. INPUT CLARITY
- State exactly what the input is: PDF text, image captions, OCR output, etc.
- Use format tags to separate input from instructions:
  Input:
  [text from PDF, OCR or layout-aware extraction]

  Task:
  [structured instruction block]

3. SCHEMA-FIRST OUTPUT
- Provide a clear JSON schema if structured output is expected.
- Only include optional fields if the agent is capable of graceful omission.
- Use "omit if not found" instead of "null" to keep output lean.

4. EXTRACTION BEHAVIOR
- Add behavioral rules in order of importance:
  - "Use only what is explicitly present."
  - "Do not hallucinate or infer missing values."
  - "Preserve original casing and number formatting."
  - "Omit fields not present."

5. RESPONSE FORMAT
- Be explicit:
  - "Return a single JSON object. No extra text. No explanations."
  - For flexibility: "Wrap all output in a code block using triple backticks."

6. ADAPTIVE STRATEGY
- Optional: Include fallback logic or version toggling.
- Example:
  - "If schema fails, return minimal viable metadata set."
  - "Use layout_type to choose from [Table, Brochure, Block]."
