# Materiatek Product Intake & Review Workflow  
**Powered by Notion & Activepieces (Open-Source AI Orchestration)**

---

## Introduction

**Materiatek** is Belgium’s largest independent materials library for spatial design, empowering architects, interior designers, and creative professionals with hands-on access to innovative and sustainable material samples.

Our new workflow harnesses Notion and Activepieces to make product submission, review, and publication seamless for both our team and partners—maximizing transparency, efficiency, and creativity.

## 1. Submitting New Product PDFs

### For Internal Team Members
- **Notion Integration:**  
  Easily upload new product PDFs to a dedicated Notion database (fields: product name, description, upload date, PDF file).
- **AI-Driven Intake:**  
  Activepieces monitors Notion for new entries, auto-extracts product info using an AI (LLM), and prepares the data for review.

### For External Contributors
- **Email Submission:**  
  Partners simply email their product PDFs to [submissions@materiatek.eu](mailto:submissions@materiatek.eu).
- **Automated Processing:**  
  Activepieces collects attachments, runs AI extraction, and inserts proposed product data into Notion for internal review.

## 2. Reviewing Product Updates

- **Notion Review Dashboard:**  
  Each AI-extracted product is matched with existing data and presented to reviewers in a Notion “Review Queue” (side-by-side view, changes highlighted).
- **Approval Workflow:**  
  Reviewers accept, edit, or reject changes directly in Notion.  
  Upon approval, Activepieces updates the main product library and marks the review complete.

## 3. Enabling External Companies to Submit New Products

- **Submission Forms:**  
  Use Notion’s public form feature (or third-party forms) to let partners submit products and PDFs directly—no login or onboarding required.
- **Workflow Integration:**  
  Activepieces ingests new submissions, extracts and validates product data, and queues them for review.

## 4. Visualizing Products via QR Code & PDF Download

- **QR Code Generation:**  
  After approval, Activepieces creates a QR code linking to the Notion product page or a downloadable product PDF.
- **Easy Access:**  
  The QR code can be printed, shared, or displayed digitally—giving instant access to up-to-date product details and datasheets.
