# MULTIPLE PDF HANDLING SPECIFICATION

## Overview
This specification defines how multiple PDF attachments from a single email are processed consistently across all pipeline versions.

## Multi-PDF Processing Principles

1. **Independent Processing**: Each PDF attachment is processed independently
2. **Status Aggregation**: Email succeeds if at least one PDF succeeds
3. **Single Notification**: One email notification for all PDFs per email
4. **Tracking Preservation**: Maintain clear relationship between email and all PDFs
5. **Format Consistency**: Multi-PDF and single-PDF handling remain compatible

## Core Processing Rules

### PDF Detection
- Scan all email attachments for PDF MIME type (`application/pdf`)
- Process only valid PDF files
- Ignore non-PDF attachments

### ID Schema
```
document_id: "doc-{timestamp}-{index}"
group_id: "email-{timestamp}"
```

Where:
- `timestamp`: Unix timestamp when email was received
- `index`: Zero-based index of PDF within the email
- `group_id`: Shared identifier for all PDFs from same email

### Processing Flow
```
Email → [PDF₁, PDF₂, ...] → Document Validator → [Item₁, Item₂, ...]
```

Each PDF becomes a separate processing item with:
- Unique `document_id`
- Shared `group_id`
- Attachment metadata (`attachment_index`, `total_attachments`)

### Status Aggregation Rules

**Email Success Criteria:**
- At least one PDF processes successfully
- Partial success is supported (some PDFs succeed, others fail)

**Email Failure Criteria:**
- All PDFs fail to process
- No valid PDFs found in email

### Notification Consolidation

**Single Email Response:**
- Consolidate results from all PDFs in the same email
- Group successful and failed PDFs by confidence levels
- Include summary of processing status for each PDF
- Send one notification per original email

## Implementation Requirements

### Document Validator
- MUST detect all PDF attachments in email
- MUST create separate processing items for each PDF
- MUST assign unique `document_id` and shared `group_id`
- MUST include attachment metadata in each item

### Processing Stages
- MUST process each PDF independently through pipeline
- MUST maintain `group_id` throughout processing
- MUST preserve attachment metadata

### Result Consolidation
- MUST group results by `group_id` before notification
- MUST apply aggregation rules for email-level success/failure
- MUST format consolidated response with all PDF results

## Benefits

- **Scalability**: Handle any number of PDFs per email
- **Reliability**: Partial success prevents total email failure
- **Clarity**: Single notification reduces email clutter
- **Traceability**: Complete audit trail for each PDF
- **Consistency**: Uniform handling across pipeline versions

## Backward Compatibility

Single-PDF emails work seamlessly:
- `group_id` contains one `document_id`
- Aggregation rules still apply (1 PDF = email success if PDF succeeds)
- Notification format remains consistent
