IMPORTANT: Add real PDF test documents to this directory.

The test script requires actual PDF documents to test the extraction pipeline:

1. single_product.pdf - A document with one product
2. multi_product.pdf - A document with multiple products
3. mixed_confidence.pdf - A document with products of varying quality

Place these files in this directory before running the tests.
