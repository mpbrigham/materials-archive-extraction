PROMPT STYLE GUIDELINES (v2)
==============================

1. LANGUAGE AND TONE
--------------------
- Use precise, non-editorial language.
- Avoid conversational phrases.
- Always issue instructions in imperative form ("Extract...", "Do not...").

2. CONSISTENCY
--------------
- Always use double quotes in JSON examples.
- Maintain consistent field naming and ordering.
- Reuse exact terms from schema definitions.

3. HALLUCINATION CONTROL
------------------------
- State explicitly: "Do not invent values not present in the document."
- Prioritize layout-based, repeated, and emphasized information only.
- If uncertain, omit the value or use fallback (`null`, `"UNKNOWN"`).

4. CASING AND ORIGINALITY
-------------------------
- Preserve original casing from source layout (even if inconsistent).
- Never normalize to lowercase, sentence case, or title case.

5. KEYWORD INCLUSION LOGIC
--------------------------
Include only:
- Repeated terms across sections
- Visually emphasized terms (bold, all-caps, headers)
- Phrases used as section titles or headings

Exclude:
- Terms found only in dense tables
- Technical jargon without visual anchoring

6. PROMPT STRUCTURE
-------------------
- Start with: Agent Role → Task Objective → Input/Output Expectations → Rules → JSON Example
- Separate sections with all-caps headers and horizontal dashes.
- Always conclude with explicit formatting or validation rules.
