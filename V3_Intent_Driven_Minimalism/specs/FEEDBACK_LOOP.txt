# Feedback Loop Specification

1. Feedback Token:
   - Each MER or Completion Manifest may optionally include a `feedback_token` (UUID).
   - This token links responses back to the originator or system for correction flow.

2. Feedback Intake:
   - Implement an inbox, webhook, or annotation interface to receive human corrections or comments.

3. Feedback Payload Example:
{
  "feedback_token": "<uuid>",
  "document_id": "<document_id>",
  "corrections": {
    "dimensions": "1200x600 mm",
    "origin_country": "France"
  },
  "comment": "Fire rating seems incorrect. Please verify with updated supplier sheet."
}

4. Routing:
   - Feedback is routed back to either:
     a. Verifier Agent for re-validation
     b. Archive note for traceable override
