# IMIS V3: Go-Live Readiness Patch

This patch contains essential missing elements for V3 production launch:

- Agent Interface Contracts (AGENT_INTERFACE_CONTRACTS_v3.txt)
- Confidence Policy Guidelines (CONFIDENCE_POLICY_GUIDELINES_v3.txt)
- State Transition Logic (STATE_ENGINE_SPEC_v3.txt)
- Prompt Versioning Notes
- Feedback Loop Specification
- DocumentLifecycleLog Example Format

These components ensure traceability, version safety, and auditability for each intelligent agent stage.

Final deployment should ensure:
- Prompts include _metadata
- State transitions are logged or streamed
- Feedback intake system is optionally connected
