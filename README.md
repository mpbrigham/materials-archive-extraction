## Guiding Koan

> A supplier sends a PDF.  
> The apprentice reads it with eyes.  
> The master reads it with silence.  
>
> The apprentice asks, “Which field is required?”  
> The master replies, “The one that is present.”  
>
> “How shall I validate truth?”  
> “Do not chase it. Let structure reveal it.”  
>
> “And if it fails?”  
> The master smiles. “All systems do.  
> The wise one builds with grace in failure.”
