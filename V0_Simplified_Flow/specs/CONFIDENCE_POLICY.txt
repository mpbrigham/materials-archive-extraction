# CONFIDENCE POLICY (V0)

## Thresholds
1. Trust threshold: confidence ≥ 0.9
2. Fallback threshold: 0.7 ≤ confidence < 0.9
3. Failure threshold: confidence < 0.7

## Product Array Processing
- Documents may contain multiple products as an array
- Each product in the array is evaluated independently
- Confidence policy applies separately to each product
- Document succeeds if at least one product passes validation

## Implementation Notes
- Implemented in the LLM Extraction agent
- Processes product arrays with independent evaluation
- Uses prompt-based processing rather than hard-coded rules
- Maintains the same state transitions and confidence thresholds
- Provides detailed explanations for decisions per product
- Works seamlessly with existing verifier pipeline
- Supports partial success when processing multiple products
