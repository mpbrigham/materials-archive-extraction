PROMPT STYLE GUIDELINES
========================

“The master does not shout. The prompt does not sprawl.”

These guidelines define tone, structure flow, and formatting best practices — the HOW and FEEL of your prompts.

1. LANGUAGE
- Use direct, polite, declarative tone.
  Example: "Extract the following fields from this supplier document."
- Avoid apologetics, hedging, or passive phrasing.
- Never anthropomorphize unnecessarily.

2. SECTIONAL FORM
Use this structure:

System Instruction:
[global rule set for the LLM or agent]

Input:
[actual document content, OCR, or file reference]

Schema:
{ JSON schema here }

Instructions:
- Rule 1
- Rule 2
- Rule 3

3. FORMATTING STANDARDS
- Use consistent labels: Input, Instructions, Schema, Output format.
- Prefer monospaced blocks for JSON or technical items.
- Use --- or ### as separators when needed.

4. LENGTH CONSIDERATIONS
- Stay under 1.5K tokens for base prompt when possible.
- Load examples only if behavior deviates from schema.
- Use schema over sample data for clarity and compactness.

5. VERSIONING
- Add a version tag at the top:
  Prompt Version: v1.2.0

6. CONCISENESS WITH CLARITY
- Every word earns its place. Remove fluff.
- Clarity does not require verbosity.
- Short, active sentences > long conditional blocks.
