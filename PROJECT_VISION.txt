PROJECT VISION
==============

The Intelligent Materials Intake System (IMIS) is a modular, scalable, and graceful architecture
designed to automate the extraction, structuring, and validation of metadata from architectural
material supplier PDFs. Its purpose is not merely automation—but to set a new standard for elegance,
resilience, and clarity in prompt-engineered agent workflows.

Three versions are presented as a case study of evolution:
- V1: Linear logic, fast to implement
- V2: Modular expansion, highly expressive
- V3: Intent-driven minimalism, future-aligned

This repository serves as both a production-ready toolkit and a teaching artifact—for architects
of data, intelligence, and language.
