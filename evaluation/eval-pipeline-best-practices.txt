        EVALUATION OF BEST PRACTICES ALIGNMENT
==================================================================

OBJECTIVE:
Evaluate the pipeline‚Äôs adherence to production-grade best practices across 
all stages of metadata extraction, segmentation, and TOC consolidation.

------------------------------------------------------------------
AS YOU REVIEW THE BEST PRACTICES SUMMARY, COMMENT ON:

‚úÖ WHAT WORKED WELL
- Was the pipeline clearly modular, with clean stage separation and contracts?
- Were layout-first principles consistently applied in classification, segmentation, and extraction?
- Was confidence-based decision-making present and meaningfully applied?
- Was degradation and fallback handling conservatively managed across stages?
- Did metadata extraction prioritize purpose-first, layout-anchored fields without semantic hallucination?
- Were normalization, deduplication, and field capping strategies clearly described?

‚ö†Ô∏è CHALLENGES
- Were any stages too reliant on subjective decisions versus layout signals?
- Did fallback logic cover all anticipated degraded or ambiguous cases?
- Were any critical ambiguities or exceptions left unaddressed?
- Was any risk of semantic drift or over-extraction observable in edge cases?

üåÄ PROMPT AMBIGUITIES
- Was modularity and pipeline composability evident and verifiable?
- Were the field definitions, error handling structures, and fallback pathways unambiguous?
- Was confidence thresholding rigorously integrated into extraction, segmentation, and consolidation?
- Were layout degradation scenarios sufficiently anticipated and addressed?

üõ† SUGGESTIONS
- Could confidence adjustment factors be expanded for new edge patterns?
- Recommend refinements to normalization rules for extremely fragmented layout cases.
- Suggest future-proofing steps for evolving multimodal model capabilities (e.g., higher-resolution OCR, enhanced layout parsing).
- Propose strategies for further minimizing processing errors in severely degraded archives.

üìé (OPTIONAL) INCLUDE EXAMPLES
Reference summaries, document clusters, or edge cases where pipeline best practices 
were especially strong or could be further improved.

------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES:
- Focus on evaluating adherence to pipeline-wide principles ‚Äî not a single stage‚Äôs logic.
- Emphasize modularity, conservativeness, clarity, and layout-anchored metadata fidelity.
- Assume the "Best Practices Summary" describes the final deployed pipeline.
