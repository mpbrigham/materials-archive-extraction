        EVALUATION OF DOCUMENT METADATA EXTRACTION
==================================================================

OBJECTIVE:
Evaluate the effectiveness of the Document Metadata Extraction prompt in 
producing structured, layout-anchored metadata and contextual summaries from 
segmented documents.

------------------------------------------------------------------
AS YOU REVIEW EACH DOCUMENT, COMMENT ON:

‚úÖ WHAT WORKED WELL
- Was the summary concise and layout-anchored with key metadata highlighted?
- Were keywords deduplicated and drawn from high-confidence visual sources?
- Were structured fields (e.g., Drawing Number, Supplier, AKZ) extracted with correct formatting?
- Were values properly normalized (e.g., date formats, suffixes, serials)?
- Did the output follow all formatting and casing standards?

‚ö†Ô∏è CHALLENGES
- Were any fields overpopulated from dense tables or footnotes?
- Did visual ambiguity or scan degradation cause missed metadata?
- Was there any evidence of hallucinated or inferred values?
- Were compound fields (e.g., grouped AKZs, multiple serials) misinterpreted?

üåÄ PROMPT AMBIGUITIES
- Was it clear when to rely on segment metadata versus layout cues?
- Were criteria for including items in Keywords sufficiently strict?
- Was handling of optional fields (e.g., KWU Type, Serial Number) consistent?
- Was it obvious how to treat multilingual or partial field labels?

üõ† SUGGESTIONS
- Could keyword selection be made stricter to avoid table spillover?
- Recommend clarifying regex/format rules for Serial Number and AKZ normalization.
- Should fallback Summary support from segment metadata be expanded?
- Suggest any additions to the Document Type list if gaps were observed.

üìé (OPTIONAL) INCLUDE EXAMPLES
Cite document indices or metadata patterns that were extracted well or incorrectly.

------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES:
- This task evaluates document metadata accuracy, structure, and anchoring.
- TOC-level summaries are reviewed separately.
- Emphasize layout-anchored metadata over inferred content.
